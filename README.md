# Pub-Files

`Assets` directory = Image files for nudge

`Configuration Files` directory = Ready to go files for nudge

`MDM Commands` directory = Script to grab image assets (update screenshots, nice rainbow coloured apple logo, etc) and dump them in /tmp/. You can just copy and paste the script as a custom command in mosyle to grab images on user sign in.

You can choose to use either the `nudge-macos.mobileconfig` file which is entirely self contained and won't use anything from outside the mac itself, or `nudge-macos-web.mobileconfig` which will instead ping the `com.github.macadmins.Nudge.json` file for new info every 30 mins.

Config files are aligned to Essential 8. 
Meaning if there's a critical flaw being patched, you have 3 days to update. Otherwise you have 14 days.
